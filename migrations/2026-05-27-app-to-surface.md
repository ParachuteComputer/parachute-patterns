# app → surface rename

The "app" name was always a placeholder. The 2026-05-26 team meeting surfaced the rename: "surface" is what we actually mean — a lens / projection / front-end into a vault, not a self-contained "app." Aaron's call: clean migration, no `/app/*` back-compat redirects, full rename including the GitHub repo.

Confidence to do it clean: nobody is on it except Aaron's local install + his Render demo. He'll re-install as `surface` after the migration lands.

## Scope

- npm package `@openparachute/app` → `@openparachute/surface`
- npm package `@openparachute/app-client` → `@openparachute/surface-client`
- GitHub repo `parachute-app` → `parachute-surface` (GitHub redirects the old URL)
- Module identifier in services.json: `parachute-app` → `parachute-surface`
- Mount path: `/app` → `/surface`
- Bin: `parachute-app` → `parachute-surface`
- Canonical port table: row name `parachute-app` → `parachute-surface` (port 1946 unchanged)
- Hub `KNOWN_MODULES`/`FIRST_PARTY_FALLBACKS`/install-spec entries
- Hub admin SPA copy + module catalog labels
- Patterns + site doc references

## What's NOT renamed

- The `notes-ui` package and bundled-app slot stays named `notes-ui`. Notes is an app/surface; it doesn't carry the parent term in its name.
- The `uis` field in module.json (or whatever the host module calls its hosted-app registry) — defer that rename; it's internal-only and not user-facing.

## Operator-state migration

The `RETIRED_MODULES` entry for `parachute-app` is the load-bearing piece: existing operators (Aaron's local + the Render demo) will load services.json on hub boot, the GC drops the stale `parachute-app` row with a console warning naming `parachute-surface` as the replacement, and the operator re-runs `parachute install surface` to add the row back under the new name. This mirrors the agent → app retirement pattern from 2026-05-20.

Aaron's local install will need: `parachute stop app` (to free the process holding port 1946), then `parachute install surface`. The existing `/parachute/modules/node_modules/@openparachute/app/` package directory can be deleted manually or left — `bun add @openparachute/surface` writes alongside.

## Audit

Run [`../scripts/audit-canonical-refs.sh`](../scripts/audit-canonical-refs.sh) after the rename lands to catch missed `parachute-app` references in unexpected places. Update the audit script's grep patterns if needed.
