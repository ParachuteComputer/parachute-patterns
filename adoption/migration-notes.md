## 2026-04-26 — Hub is the OAuth issuer

**Change:** the hub origin is the canonical OAuth issuer for the
ecosystem. Vault still implements the OAuth endpoints, but advertises
the hub as `issuer` (and stamps it into token `iss` claims) whenever
the request reaches it via the hub origin. Falls back to the
vault-local URL on direct loopback. See
[`patterns/hub-as-issuer.md`](../patterns/hub-as-issuer.md); pairs
with [`patterns/oauth-scopes.md`](../patterns/oauth-scopes.md).

**Affected:**

- `parachute-vault` — already implements the contract. Reference:
  `resolveOAuthCoordinates` in `src/oauth.ts`, landed in
  [#147](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-vault/pull/147)
  and refined in
  [#152](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-vault/pull/152).
- `parachute-cli` (renaming to `parachute-hub` —
  [cli#55](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-cli/issues/55))
  — derives the canonical hub origin in `src/hub-origin.ts` and passes
  it through as `PARACHUTE_HUB_ORIGIN` on `expose up` / `start`.
- `parachute-scribe`, `parachute-channel`, future modules — when they
  begin OAuth enforcement, validate `iss` against the hub origin (not
  their own URL). No code change needed before they implement OAuth.
- Phase B2 cutover (hub becomes IdP itself) tracked in
  [cli#58](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-cli/issues/58)
  and
  [vault#169](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-vault/issues/169).

**Status:** Phase 0+1 complete on 2026-04-23. Phase B2 in design.

## 2026-04-26 — Writes require `if_updated_at` (or explicit `force: true`)

**Change:** Parachute write APIs require an `if_updated_at`
precondition by default; `force: true` is the explicit opt-out.
Conflicts return a structured 409 (`error_type: "conflict"` +
`current_updated_at` / `your_updated_at` / `path` / `note_id`);
missing precondition returns a structured 428 (RFC 6585,
`error_type: "precondition_required"`). Single-resource reads
always include `updated_at` so the next write has a token. See
[`patterns/optimistic-concurrency.md`](../patterns/optimistic-concurrency.md).

**Affected:**

- `parachute-vault` — reference implementation.
  [#153](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-vault/pull/153)
  landed required `if_updated_at` + the structured conflict shape.
  Both HTTP (`src/routes.ts`) and MCP (`src/mcp-http.ts`) tool
  surfaces enforce identically.
- `parachute-notes` — must forward `if_updated_at` from PWA edits to
  vault writes; don't strip it. PWA's local store should hold the
  last-seen `updated_at` per note.
- Future API-surface modules — adopt the same shape on every mutating
  endpoint over a database-backed resource. Pattern doc has the rules.

**Status:** complete for vault on 2026-04-23 (PR #153). Notes adoption
ongoing — confirm on next touch.

## 2026-04-25 — CLI is the port authority at install time

**Change:** `parachute install` now picks each service's port up front and
writes `PORT=<n>` into `~/.parachute/<svc>/.env`. Idempotent — an existing
`PORT` in `.env` wins, so re-installs and user-edited ports survive
upgrades. See [`patterns/cli-as-port-authority.md`](../patterns/cli-as-port-authority.md);
pairs with [`patterns/canonical-ports.md`](../patterns/canonical-ports.md).

**Affected:**

- `parachute-cli` — implemented in
  [#54](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-cli/pull/54)
  (closes #53). Helper: `src/port-assign.ts`. Hook: `src/commands/install.ts`.
- `parachute-vault`, `parachute-notes`, `parachute-scribe`,
  `parachute-channel` — no service-side changes required. Each already
  reads `PORT` from env with a compiled-in fallback; the CLI's `.env`
  value is merged into the spawn env by `lifecycle.start`. Confirm the
  pattern on the next touch and add a comment if a service hard-codes its
  port instead of reading env.
- Third-party / future modules — same contract: read `PORT` from env, fall
  back compiled-in, no integration with the CLI required.

**Status:** complete for committed-core services on 2026-04-25.

## 2026-04-15 — `parachute-*` bin naming

**Change:** all Parachute executables adopt the `parachute-<module>` prefix
(see `naming/bins.md`). The umbrella `parachute` bin is reserved for
`@openparachute/cli`.

**Affected:**

- `parachute-vault` — renamed `parachute` → `parachute-vault` in
  [#134](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-vault/pull/134) (2026-04-21).
- `parachute-scribe` — renamed `scribe` → `parachute-scribe` in
  [#9](https://github.com/ParachuteComputer/parachute-scribe/pull/9) (2026-04-22).
- `parachute-narrate` — not yet published; will ship as
  `parachute-narrate` from day one.
- `parachute-channel` — conformant (`parachute-channel`, `parachute-channel-bridge`).
- `parachute-agents` — conformant (`parachute-agent`, `parachute-agent-ui`).
- `tailshare` — exempt; not a Parachute-branded tool.

**Status:** complete for shipped modules. Narrate to follow on first publish.

## 2026-04-15 — parachute-patterns repo created

**Change:** this repo exists. Conventions that were implicit across the
ecosystem (naming, brand palette, agent schema, modularity principle, etc.)
are now written down.

**Affected:** every Parachute repo eventually needs a README link back to
this repo (`adoption/checklist.md`). Non-urgent — add as repos get touched.

**Status:** in progress.

## Template

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line change>

**Change:** what changed and why. Link to the pattern file.

**Affected:** which repos need to follow and what specifically each needs
to do.

**Status:** DRAFT | in progress | complete.
