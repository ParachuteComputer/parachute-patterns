## 2026-04-15 — `parachute-*` bin naming

**Change:** all Parachute executables adopt the `parachute-<module>` prefix
(see `naming/bins.md`). The umbrella `parachute` bin is reserved for
`@openparachute/cli`.

**Affected:**

- `parachute-vault` — currently ships `parachute`; **rename to
  `parachute-vault`** (pending). Blocks umbrella dispatch.
- `parachute-scribe` — ships `scribe`; rename to `parachute-scribe`.
- `parachute-narrate` — ships `narrate`; rename to `parachute-narrate`.
- `parachute-channel` — conformant (`parachute-channel`, `parachute-channel-bridge`).
- `parachute-agents` — conformant (`parachute-agent`, `parachute-agent-ui`).
- `tailshare` — exempt; not a Parachute-branded tool.

**Status:** [DRAFT] — renames not yet executed. File per-repo issues to
track each rename.

## 2026-04-15 — parachute-patterns repo created

**Change:** this repo exists. Conventions that were implicit across the
ecosystem (naming, brand palette, agent schema, modularity principle, etc.)
are now written down.

**Affected:** every Parachute repo eventually needs a README link back to
this repo (`adoption/checklist.md`). Non-urgent — add as repos get touched.

**Status:** in progress.
